# College Football Score Prediction System

## Project Overview
This project implements a sophisticated machine learning system for predicting college football game outcomes and scores. The system combines multiple prediction models with real-time data integration to provide accurate game predictions based on historical performance and team statistics.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.x** - Primary programming language
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning implementation
- **pandas/numpy** - Data processing and numerical computations
- **Flask** - Web application framework
- **Google Cloud Platform** - Cloud deployment and storage
- **JSON/CSV** - Data storage and API integration

### Machine Learning Models

#### 1. Dual Model Approach
- **Classification Model**: Random Forest Classifier
  - Predicts game outcome (win/loss)
  - Trained using historical game data
  - Features: day of week, location, team statistics
  - Implements k-fold cross-validation

- **Regression Model**: Linear Regression
  - Predicts exact game scores
  - Separate predictions for each team
  - Features include:
    - Total points scored/allowed
    - Win percentage
    - Recent performance (last 4 games)
    - Home/Away advantage

#### 2. Feature Engineering
- Custom statistical calculations:
  - Rolling win percentages
  - Point differentials
  - Home/Away performance metrics
  - Team-specific historical performance
- Label encoding for categorical variables:
  - Team names
  - Game locations
  - Days of the week
  - League information

### Data Pipeline

#### 1. Data Collection
- Real-time API integration with PepplerStats
- Automated schedule updates
- JSON data parsing and validation
- Historical game data aggregation

#### 2. Data Processing
- Automated data cleaning
- Missing value handling
- Feature normalization
- Team name standardization
- Custom DataFrame transformations

#### 3. Model Pipeline
- Automated model training
- Model persistence using pickle/dill
- Cross-validation implementation
- Performance metric tracking
- Prediction confidence scoring

### Cloud Architecture

#### Google Cloud Platform Integration
- Cloud Storage for model persistence
- App Engine deployment
- Automated scaling
- Scheduled data updates (cron jobs)
- Static file serving
